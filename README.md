# final-project
This is my final project.

For my final Drawing on the Web project, I will create an interactive experience that simulates the creative process of fashion design.  The first drawing will allow the user to explore a variety of custom patterns and fabrics.  These materials will be responsive, coming to life in different ways as the user hovers and clicks.  For example, as the mouse hovers on the apples in the first design, their colors will change, and upon clicking on the lemons in the second design, they will spin around.  These elements will be created with CSS Animation or JavaScript.  After exploring the numerous designs, the user will be invited to view the second drawing, which, in response to the mouse’s movement (much like a scratch-off art project), will reveal a two-dimensional sketch of the garment.  This will be rendered directly in the browser using HTML Canvas.  The third drawing will be a three-dimensional rendering, which the user will be able to spin around so as to view it from all angles.  The pattern depicted as the garment’s material will be randomized from the various options offered in the first drawing and will thus be a surprise each time the page is reloaded.  This final drawing will be created using WebGL.  I will also include a navigational page that will link to each drawing via interactive buttons.
